# Student Gradebook Manager

## Overview

The Student Gradebook Manager is a console-based Java application designed to help educators efficiently manage student grades and assignments. This software provides a user-friendly interface for tracking student performance, calculating averages, and generating class statistics.

My purpose in creating this software was to demonstrate proficiency in Java programming while solving a real-world problem faced by educators. This project showcases my ability to design object-oriented solutions, implement file I/O operations, and create practical applications with clean, maintainable code.
